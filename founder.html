    <p>
      The way people discover your company is changing. They don’t just Google you—they ask GPT-4. They ask Claude. They ask whatever model powers their assistant or agent.
    </p>

    <p>
      And those models don’t just recite—they interpret. They summarize, reshape, and sometimes distort what you’ve said. Your press releases, blog posts, interviews, and product pages become inputs in an invisible game of telephone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Narradar exists to make that game visible. It’s a tool for understanding how AI and media reframe your message—what sticks, what warps, and what drifts over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m building this because I think the next wave of brand strategy isn’t just about what *you* say—it’s about what *the models* say on your behalf. And right now, most teams aren’t listening.
    </p>

    <p>
      If that sounds interesting—or if you’re working on a similar problem—reach out. I’d love to compare notes.
